1- Challenges faced during the project.

 During this project, one of the main challenges I faced was managing the task data efficiently while keeping the UI in sync with user actions. Handling multiple features such as adding tasks, updating statuses, filtering by category or status, and automatically marking tasks as overdue required careful organization of the JavaScript logic. Another challenge was ensuring that the data persisted correctly using local storage, especially when updating or filtering tasks without losing information.

2- How you approached solving those challenges.

 To solve these challenges, I broke the project into smaller, manageable parts. I started with core functionality like adding and displaying tasks, then gradually added features such as status updates, filtering, and local storage. Using functions to separate concerns helped keep the code readable and easier to debug. Regular testing after each feature helped identify issues early.

3- What you would improve if given more time.

 If given more time, I would improve the user interface with better styling and animations, add task editing and deletion features, and enhance validation and error handling to further improve the user experience.
